# Pcam_Deep_Learning
In this project I built my own custom deep learning framework as part of a class and tested its ability by creating mutiple different CNN architectures to predict whether cancer is metastatic or not based off of images of biopsied lymph node tissue sourced from here: https://github.com/basveeling/pcam?tab=readme-ov-file#patchcamelyon-pcam. The file Layer.py was not written by me and I also take no credit for the generation or storage of the data used in this project, all other portions of the project however were created solely by me.

The project notebook is where I built and tested each CNN model architecture, I also included a graph of each model's testing accuracy across epochs, unfortunutaly due to time and computational constraints I was only able to use a tiny fraction of the available data across a limited number of training epochs, however I belive that the novelty of this project still stands as it each model does show clear signs of learning during training which validates the efficacy of my custom built framework. In addition to this, I believe that if trained on the full breadth of the data across a more reasonable number of epochs (n >= 100) that the performance of these models would meet or perhaps even exceed the performance of models trained using pre-built frameworks such as those found in TensorFlow.
